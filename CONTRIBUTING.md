# Contributing

Thanks for choosing to contribute to this repository. When I started out, there wasn't a single repository or service I could find that provided high quality design assets for Indian banks and all the data was scattered as well. A lot of scouting and sourcing is done to get to where this repository is today. I am sure, your help can make it even better.

## Logos
For logos, this repo will only host SVGs. Logos are usually divided into two pieces
1. The full logo.
2. The symbol / small logo.

| Logo                                       | Symbol                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| ![HDFC Logo](./assets/logos/hdfc/logo.svg) | ![HDFC Symbol](assets/logos/hdfc/symbol.svg) |

The symbol is pretty useful in building mobile interfaces that require you to list banks. 

For each bank that you are going to add the logos, make sure you have at least these two.
