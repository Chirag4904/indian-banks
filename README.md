## Sponsorship & Contribution
If you or your organization uses this repository for bank related data, please consider sponsoring me. It has taken me hours of work to get high quality vectors right and source data from multiple places after a lot of manual verification. 

As you can imagine, this is a time consuming effort and it would be amazing if you can [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to this repository.
